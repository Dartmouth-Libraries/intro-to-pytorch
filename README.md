# Intro To Pytorch

A gentle introduction to the neural network framework [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). This material was created for a Reproducible Research workshop offered at Dartmouth College. While it is best used as part of a code-along session, it can also be consumed as a stand-alone tutorial.

## Session description
Deep Learning for everyone! PyTorch is a free and open source machine learning framework for the rapid development of neural networks for applications in computer vision, natural language processing, or speech recognition. It provides a simple Python interface, which makes it equally popular in education, research, and production environments. If a problem falls into fairly standard categories, powerful pre-trained models are available out-of-the-box. If a custom model is required, PyTorch makes it easy to define, train, and test neural networks using state-of-the-art algorithms and components from simple feed-forward networks to convolutional networks to LSTMs, transformers and more.

In this session, you will get a brief overview of the components provided by PyTorch. We will apply a pre-trained model to a problem with just a few lines of code, and we will define our own neural network! Finally, we will introduce the concept of transfer learning, which allows you to benefit from pre-trained models even if your particular problem is different from what the model was originally trained on!

## Getting Started

### Requirements
- Basic Python programming skills are required to do the code-along.
- A good grasp of the fundamentals of neural networks will help you get the most out of this course.

### Install
The material is provided as Jupyter notebooks. To run them, you need some kind of Jupyter server. Some options are:
- A [local Jupyter installation](https://jupyter.org/install)
- [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/)
- The [Dartmouth JupyterHub](https://jhub.dartmouth.edu/) (Dartmouth-only)

### Usage
The repo contains a single notebook:
- `intro-to-pytorch.ipynb`
  - This notebook is intended to be used in a code-along session. It contains instructions and background info, as well as fully functional code. You are encouraged in several places to modify the material and go beyond the presented solutions to deepen your knowledge of PyTorch.
