    "PyTorch is a machine learning framework with a major focus on neural networks used for computer vision, audio and natural language processing. The user-facing frontend is written in Python, but the number-crunching is handled by a more optimized C++ backend, including support for outsourcing computations to graphics cards (GPUs) for a substantial increase in speed. PyTorch was originally created by Meta (formerly known as facebook), but has always been open source, permissively licensed ([BSD-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses#3-clause)), and since September 2022 is managed by the non-profit PyTorch Foundation, a subsidiary of the [Linux Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Foundation).\n",
